# A Solidity Inspector 

#### 

Surya is an utility tool for smart contract systems. It provides a number of visual outputs and information about the contracts' structure. Also supports querying the function call graph in multiple ways to aid in the manual inspection of contracts.

Currently only supports Solidity but we hope to extend the tool to encompass other languages.

The name stems from the sun deity [Surya](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surya)

Why the sun, you ask? Because "sun" in latin and portuguese is [*Sol*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_deity).


## Getting Started

Install it via NPM:

```shell
npm install -g surya
```
